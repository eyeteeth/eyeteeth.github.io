title:  _re:form_: Keeping Track: The Political Railway Graffiti of IMPEACH 
date:   2015-03-14

---

"Getting up" is one of Minneapolis-based graffiti artist IMPEACH's aims, but unlike many of his peers, it's in service not just to ego, but to a bigger idea: he's creating politically charged messages on the side of traincars that speed across the US heartland in hopes of raising awareness of economic disparities, governmental corruption, and corporate malfeasance. Commissioned by _re:form_, _Medium_'s design colletion, this piece profiles the pseudonymous creator of--as curator and _Justseeds_ founder Josh MacPhee puts it--“an entirely new art form--behemoth metal broadsheets, tracking the news across North America.”
