>In Minnesota on a 20-below-zero day, Erik Brandt is certainly not alone in his liberal use of windshield-wiper fluid to stave off ice formation. But he’s not using it on his windshield.  

>For the past 15 months, Brandt, a professor at the Minneapolis College of Art and Design, has been curating an outdoor poster show by an array of global graphic design innovators. He’s featured work by icons, iconoclastic young phenoms, and little-known student talents alike, mixing names likes Ed Fella, Shiraz Gallab, Felix Pfäffli, Reza Abedini, Janneke Meekes, and Terrell Davis.  

>Brandt’s gallery is a 36 x 72-inch panel on the side of his garage in Minneapolis’ Powderhorn Park neighborhood, a humble space that every Friday counts among its visitors the stinking truck that clatters by to haul off garbage.
