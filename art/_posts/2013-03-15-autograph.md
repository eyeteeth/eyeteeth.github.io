"Can I have my autograph?" For the past 15 years or so, I've been asking people who've had an influence on me, either positively or negatively, to [sign my name](http://signifier-signed.blogspot.com/2006/12/paul-schmelzer-as-signed-by-yoko-ono.html). So far more than 80 artists, writers, and politicians have, from Yoko Ono to Laurie Anderson, Noam Chomsky to Dan Castellenata (the voice of Homer Simpson), the late Sen. Paul Wellstone to Michele Bachmann.
